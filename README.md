Python script to download files from subdirectories on github

I'd been looking for ways to download sub-directories on github. There are workarounds using SVN or you can just use GITzip.
The way that this script does that is painfully slow and is not the optimal way. It merely represents an idea and my afternoon curiosity.

PS:If you're using windows you may have to change a couple lines (58 and 66 as of now)
